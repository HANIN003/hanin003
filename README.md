### Hi there, I'm Nate ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! I am currently a Technical Director at ESPN and a recent graduate from the University of Connecticut's full stack web developer bootcamp. I am eagerly learning all I can about coding and software developement. Below you'll find some of my favorite bootcamp projects I worked on.  

I'm currently following an introduction to AWS through a continuation course from my bootcamp and I have also completed an intro course to JAVA, Python & C# through the same organization. On top of all that I am taking courses through Udemy to further my knowledge on JavaScript.

You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-hanisch/) or email me at nathan.hanisch86@gmail.com for any further questions or info about myself.

Thanks again for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹
