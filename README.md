### Hi there, I'm Nate ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out my GitHub profile! I am a technical director at ESPN and a recent graduate from the University of Connecticut's full stack web developer bootcamp. Below you'll find some of my favorite bootcamp projects I worked on.  

I'm currently learning Java with plans to follow that up with AWS, Python and C# to further expand my knowledge.  
You can check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nathan-hanisch-1598491a1/) or email me at nathan.hanisch86@gmail.com.
